# ChatroomAPP
To run the project python3 and the modules in both files have to be installed on your machine.<br/>
The app Consists of 2 main parts(server,client1)<br/>
You can duplicate the client1 by copying and pasting the content of any client file in a new clientfile eg: client2, client3<br/>
You can have a maximum of 5 clients(or you can change the number of clients in the server file in this line sock.listen(5))<br/>
start by running server.py first then client1.py and client2..5(depending on how many users have to be in your chatroom)<br/>
