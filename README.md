# ChatroomAPP
To run the project python3 and the modules in both files have to be installed on your machine.
The app Consists of 2 main parts(server,client1)
You can duplicate the client1 by copying and pasting the content of any client file in a new clientfile eg: client2, client3
You can have a maximum of 5 clients(or you can change the number of clients in the server file in this line sock.listen(5))
start by running server.py first then client1.py and client2..5(depending on how many users have to be in your chatroom)
